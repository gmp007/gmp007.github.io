## 🚀 About Me
I am a professor, computational researcher, and AI/ML scientist with deep experience in:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, multi-agent systems, and generative AI  
- **Causal inference**, deep learning, predictive modeling, and decision science  
- **High-performance scientific computing** and physics-informed ML  
- **Enterprise ML systems** that generate measurable business impact  
- **Mathematical & computational modeling** for complex real-world systems  

My work spans academia, applied research labs, and industry — including building production-grade AI systems at **Amazon**, **Evalueserve**, delivering measurable business value through production-grade AI/ML systems, and leading multi-million-dollar AI research programs in academia.
